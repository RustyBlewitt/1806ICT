## 1806ICT Programming Fundamentals
# Weekly workshop problems and solutions with Codelite workspace files.

Each week throughout this course we're presented with small programming exercises to be completed in C. 
Completion of these have been encouraged to take place in codelite, a multi-language open source IDE.

Codelite "workspace" files have also been pushed alongside program files for ease of access.

/* Write a program that reads in the size of an array and the array elements (all of which
are integers). Your program must rearrange the numbers in the array such that every
3 is followed by a 4. Do not move the 3’s, but every other number may move. The
given array contains the same number of 3’s and 4’s. Every 3 has a number after it
that is not a 3 or 4, and a 3 appears in the array before any 4. */
